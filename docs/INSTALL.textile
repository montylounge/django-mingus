h2. Quick Start

The quick start assumes basic familiarity with "vitualenv":http://virtualenv.openplans.org/, "virtualenv wrapper":http://www.doughellmann.com/projects/virtualenvwrapper/.

It also assumes you have both subversion, mecurial, and git clients locally.

* mkvirtualenv myblog --no-site-packages
* workon myblog
* cd myblog
* git clone git://github.com/montylounge/django-mingus.git
* cd django-mingus/mingus
* pip install -r stable-requirements.txt
* ... wait a bit
* mv local_settings.py.template local_settings.py
* ./manage.py syncdb
* .manage.py loaddata test_data.json
* ./manage.py runserver

By default the theme is set to the Basic theme.

Django-Mingus also comes with 4 additional themes: Django(green), Minimal (black/white), Dark (black), Basic
(beige/red), JeffCroft (brown/pink). You can view them "here":http://www.flickr.com/photos/37875916@N07/tags/mingustheme/.

To switch "themes" just change this line in templates/base.html:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ STATIC_URL }}mingus/css/themes/basic.css" type="text/css" media="all" charset="utf-8">

You'll notice the themes/basic.css text - change that to one of the existing themes ('django', 'minimal', 'jeffcroft', 'dark'), or edit away on your own!
