1.30.10

* bumped django-proxy and django-quoteme versions
* template updates
* Fixed duplicate long description in setup.py

* added a bug to fixtures/test_data.json (later fixed this bug)
* bumped the basic-blog stable version
* added some i18n love to forms (thanks pmarti for catching that)
* migrated to montylounge fork of django-request to squash postgres syncdb related issue


1.20.10
-------

* Fixed an IE6 display issue, but it's not pretty. For the most part the
templates are provided 'as-is' since you'll most likely want to customize
them anyway. But if not, I think the default should at least look decent 
on IE6.

* setup.py and MANIFEST.in updates


1.19.10
-------

* integration django-cropper into the project
* added SQL directory to handle migrations
* added migration SQL for 2 new basic.blog columns

1.16.10
--------

* Basic-apps-blog added two field to Settings model: active_editor, 
excerpt_length.
	
	* `active_editor` allows the user to flip which editor is active (text 
	markup, tinymce, django-wyswiyg)
	* `excerpt_lenght` allows the user to define the Post.body excerpt length. 
	Currently only the RSS feed templates honor this setting but I could see 
	a use for in on list views for addition of "read more..."

* Integrated these external apps:
	* django-staticfiles
	* django-bitly
	* django-twitter
	* python-twitter
	* django-tinymce
	* django-wysiwyg
	* django-slimmer
	* django-request
	
* The above apps were mostly integrated to allow for configuring wysiwyg editor 
in admin for Posts

* Integrated a handful of community fork changes (thanks all!). Updates where to 
some template tweaks mostly.

* Integrated Google Code's prettify highlighting solution. User can easily 

* Removed django-sugar pygmentize filter throughout templates since django-markup 
runs pygmentize on markup when saving.

* Support for restructured text (now automatically hide django-inline fields on 
Post amin form when reSt is enabled because it raised syntax exceptions during 
the translation.)

* Some doc updates. *Need to add complete docs if we are to get to a 1.0 version

* Pull from updated requirement project repositories and froze on the latest 
versions of those repositories.

* Moved /fixtures/initial_data.json to /fixtures/test_data.json to avoid syncdb
related concerns regarding overwriting data.

* removed /core/context_processors.py since django-static media handles this
logic.
